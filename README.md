# A library of accessible React components

This repo is a set of React components based on the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/). It's a work in progress and intended more for learning than as production ready. I'm also [writing about the creation of each component](https://jorigg.dev/blog).

## Running the library

Clone the repo and npm install. The library uses Storybook so you can view the components using

```
npm run storybook
```
